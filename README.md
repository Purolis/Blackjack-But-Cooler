## Rough Idea
Blackjack Balatro.<br>
Basically we're making a digital version of blackjack, then getting funky with the implementation.
Possible Ideas:
- Health / Money System
- Revival System
- Life Counter
- etc.... ( We don't know yet )

## Getting Started
1. To get started, simply download the Code file [here](https://github.com/Purolis/Agile-Group-Project/tree/main/Code) and then go ahead and boot that up into the command prompt by simply cd C:\(directory). Go ahead and then just do driver.py (if in command line) or just run the driver.py file in PyCharm.
2. For now, we just have Blackjack with somewhat of a built money system, but we'd like to expand on this and will make sure to create updates! It's that simple, just S for Stand, and H for hit.
3. We have also implemented the basic Blackjack rules so your experience will be the same as the casinos!

Note: It will also work in PyCharm, but won't look as pretty.
