## Rough Idea
Blackjack Balatro.<br>
Basically we're making a digital version of blackjack, then getting funky with the implementation.
Possible Ideas:
- Health / Money System
- Revival System
- Life Counter
- etc.... ( We don't know yet )

## Getting Started
Prerequisite: you must have python3 installed and callable from your terminal

1. To play the game, first clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Purolis/Blackjack-But-Cooler.git`
2. Then open the directory of the cloned repo in the terminal of your choice.
3. if you want to play the CLI version of the game:<br>
  3.1. navigate to `Code/CLI/` directory `cd Code/CLI/`<br>
  3.2. run `python3 main.py`
4. if you want to run the GUI version of the game:<br>
  4.1. navigate to `Code/GUI/` directory `cd Code/GUI/`<br>
  4.2. run `python3 guiMain.py`

Note: It will also run in PyCharm, but won't look as pretty in the CLI version.
