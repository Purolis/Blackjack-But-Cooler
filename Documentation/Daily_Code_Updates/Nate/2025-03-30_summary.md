# Sunday
 - Gather and ensure all documentation from Sprint one and two are in the physical documentation binder.
 - Updated daily code repo to reflect my work for Sprint two.
 - Ensure physical binder is organized and looks good.
 - Do some very simple testing just to insure player input will not break game, plan to do more in depth unit testing in a later sprint.
