written synopsis of work completed

## Updates
### <code>Player.py</code>
- fleshed out <code>bet()</code> method
  - try/except validation
  - does not accept negative values
  - minimum bet implementation
  - signals player to sell items if they can not make minimum bet
- error messages (validation) are colored now
## New branch: <code>overhaul</code>
In a hyperfocused bout of autism I decided to re-write the entire driver from scratch, pretty much.<br>
It isn't fully functional, but it makes me happy.<br>
I'm so tired ðŸ˜…

There were also quite a few changes to each of the classes.

Players now have boolean flags, my thoughts there are that it would be useful for keeping track of the state of the game.<br>
Like, you can see that a player is bust, and then they can't draw more cards + they lose their bet, etc.<br>
idk it made sense to me.

Ace value calculation works better. Demonstrated in <code>test.py</code>

There's a lot in <code>test.py</code> that will help explain what I did, so please check that out if you get confused on how something works in specific.
