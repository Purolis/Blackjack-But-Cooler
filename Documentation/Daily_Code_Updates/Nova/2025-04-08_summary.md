written synopsis of work completed

## Testing results as of 11:18AM
- you can bet negative numbers, this shouldn't be possible
- the user interface could be a whole lot neater
- bet input is not validated, unhandled exceptions with raw traceback possible
- input for selling items is not validated, unhandled exceptions possible

## Updates (<code>gui_patch</code> branch)
### <code>main.py</code>
- broke it
  - completely and utterly
- this was necessary to refactor, please don't try running it, it will make your computer depressed :(

### <code>test.py</code>
- created test.py to, well, test changes I make.

### <code>Player.py</code>
- <code>\_\_str\_\_()</code> functionality added, future plans to refactor <code>main.py</code> to use this instead of manual printing operations to display player state (also it prints in pretty colors!).
- added item selling functionality to be a class method of Player, instead of arbritrary logic in <code>main.py</code>

### <code>Dealer.py</code>
- <code>\_\_str\_\_()</code> functionality added (see above)
- added <code>name</code> attribute in preparation for multiple players
