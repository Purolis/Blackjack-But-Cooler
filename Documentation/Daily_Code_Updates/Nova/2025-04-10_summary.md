written synopsis of work completed

## Updates
Hoo boy there's a lot

All of my changes were made to the <code>overhaul</code> branch.

A continuation of [yesterday](Nova/2025-04-09_summary.md), really. The game runs smoothly to the point that I can't find any bugs. 

There is nice ASCII art to enjoy :)

## Testing
There was a lot of testing done in the <code>testing.py</code> file, which I would use when I made changes to try and find edge cases. 
I do not know how to make unit tests as of this writing, so the only "testing" I could do was more by hand, with manual test creation/running and playtesting (the latter of which I did a ton).

I'm 99% sure (because one can never know anything fully) that at every instance of user input, the input is thrououghly validated with try/except blocks and is thusly handled in a way that makes it *exceedingly* difficult to crash. So, yay :3
