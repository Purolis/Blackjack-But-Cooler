**Scope Statement**

- The goal of this project is to create a game that imitates black jack with a little bit of extras to make it different. 
- The game will allow the user to play as a player against a computer dealer with user input being taken to allow the player to draw multiple cards if they want.
- The user will not be able to play as the dealer nor will the game accept multiple players.
- The twist with this game is that everytime you lose a hand in the game you lose health until you run out causing you to lose.
- The computer will also lose health whenever they lose a hand with the game ending when one of you loses all of their health.
- That is the scope of the current project.
- The user will be able to play with other computer players.
- If we have time, the user will be able to play the game on a GUI.
